# Overview

QEats is a popular food ordering app that allows users to browse and order their favorite dishes from nearby restaurants.

    1.  I had build different parts of the QEats backend which is a Spring Boot application.
    2.  Several REST API endpoints were implemented to query restaurant information and place food orders.
    3.  To give a sense of real-world problems, production issues were investigated using Scientific Debugging methods.
    4.  Along with this, I improved the app performance under large load scenarios as well as included an advanced search feature in the app.
